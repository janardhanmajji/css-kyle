Chapter-1

-> CSS stands for cascading style sheet.
-> HTML is for content of the website (information)
-> In order to make our website look better we need CSS

-> It helps for styling our websites (make them look good).

Chapter-2 (Basic Syntax)

Syntax:

 selector{
    property: value1;
    property: value2;
}

Types of selectors:

1) HTML element selector: Selects every single element of that type inside our HTML document and applies
 the properties.
Ex:- div{
    color: green;
}

2) Class selectors: Selects every single element that has class-name of that specific name and applies
 the properties.
Ex:- 

HTML: 
<div class="first"> <p>My name is Janardhan</p> </div>

CSS:

.first{
    color: blue;
}

This is the most popular way of selecting elements for CSS
We almost always use Class selectors

3) Id selector: In a HTML page ID is unique which means if a HTML page contains an ID name it must not be
 repeated. It also selects the element with that specific id and applies the properties to it.

HTML: 
<div class="first"> <p id="name">My name is Janardhan</p> </div>

CSS:

.first{
    color: blue;
}

#name{
    background-color: blue;
}

4) Everything selector:  It selects each and every element on the page and applies the properties given.

Syntax:

*{
    font-size: small;
}

***** We mostly use class selectors.

5) Custom selector: Combination of selectors.

Ex:-

If we use .class1{} it will consider all classes with name class1 and applies the properties.
But what if we want to select only the class1 present in p1, then we use

p1.class1{}

Similarly we want id2 present in class1 which is in div1 we use,
div1.class1#id2{}

We can combine like this to make our unique selector.

****Note :  To use the same properties to multiple selectors i.e, similar to or we must use comma operator.
 (Avoid duplication of code)
Ex:-  div.class1, span{} applies even if class1 is in div or if it is a span.

**** Selecting child tags

Ex:-

<div>
    <h3>Janardhan</h3>
    <h3>Likitha</h3>
<div>

We need to select all h3 present in div ----> we use space.
Syntax:

div h3{
    color : red ;
}

Chapter-3  (Ways to add CSS to a webpage)

 In order of worst to best---

 1) Inline style:

 Every single HTML tag has an inline attribute.
 <div style="color: green">Janardhan</div>

 Donot use inline styles........

 2) Writing style in the same HTML page in the head tag -- by using style tag.

 It works but the problem is there would be multiple HTML pages in our project but this type of CSS only 
 applicable to a single page. If we want to apply same style in other pages we need to use same code which
  leads to --- code duplication.

 Ex:-

 <head>
    <style>
        /*CSS code goes here*/
    </style>
</head>

3) Using an external style sheet:

create a file style.css and write all the CSS code.
Link that stylesheet with your html document as shown below-

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<!-- other meta data -->
<!-- link to our css file-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./path/to/your_file/style.css">
</head>


The link tag can link many files. To say that it is a CSS file specify rel="stylesheet"
Benifit of external style sheet is we can apply the same styles to any number of HTML pages simultaneously.

Chapter-4 (Comments)

Comments in css starts with /* and ends with */

Ex:- /* This style below is for 2nd paragraph*/

Used to explain what the code is doing. We can also comment the properties which can be ignored for now 
and when needed the comments can be removed.

Shortcut for comments: ctrl + /

->Comments can also can be used for testing
